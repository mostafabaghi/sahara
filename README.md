## 📌 About the Project

**Sahara** is a modern, fast, and responsive HTML/CSS/JS template created for the official website of Sahara Karbala. This project is a complete redesign with a focus on **UI/UX improvements**, performance optimization, and visual appeal.

- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly

- Lightweight and fast-loading
- Easy to customize for other projects

This template was **entirely handcrafted** by me, with attention to design detail and performance.
